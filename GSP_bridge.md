## Graph Signal Processing on Complex Networks for Structural Health Monitoring

**Project description:** In this work, we demonstrate the applications of \emph{Graph Signal Processing} (GSP) in a \emph{Structural Health Monitoring} (SHM) setting. 
By analyzing a large bridge equipped with strain and vibration sensors, we show that GSP is capable of selecting the most important sensors, detecting mode shapes and in general grasp the physical function of the sensors in the network. 
For the sampling, several optimization techniques to select the best set of sensors are utilized, of which the top-down hill climber performs best. 
In the case of mode shape investigation, we detect several distinct mode shapes in the data. 
The obtained results prove the functionality of GSP in handling complex sensor data.

### 1. We propose the modeling options taken for making the real-world dataset applicable for GSP using a complex network representation.

### 2. We present comprehensive analysis results, regarding sensor network modeling in a resource-aware way, aiming towards a minimal set of sensors for reconstructing the given signal

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. We provide modeling results on signal pattern and event identification
