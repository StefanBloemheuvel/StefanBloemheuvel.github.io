  PhD @ JADS, TU/e & Tilburg University
  <br><br>
  My PhD is focussed on using graph analysis on industrial / sensor data, under supervision of Dr. Habil. Martin Atzmueller. 
  <br><br>
  In Mathematics, graph theory focusses on a collection of items connected by edges. 
  With help of Graph Signal Processing, we can both use the numerical information from time-series data as well as the topological information that is apparent the graph.
